title: personal apis as data aggregators
---

Kin lane makes the point that there are already plenty of apis that contain personal information. These apis contain information and allow access on behalf of us.

### so what does this mean for all the work going into data sharing?

It is still hugely valuable. I see that work integrating with personal apis in a very important way.
realistically, we will likely always have 3rd party services which host our data. allowing permissioned access to our data on those systems will remain an important part of the future.
