I'm starting a new chapter of blogging, but I mean that in a strictly technical sense. I have been blogging, but it's been going on our family adventure blog called CurrentlyWandering. We started that blog in 2013 when we began an adventure that started with a cross-country house swap and turned into a perpetual road trip. Most of the posts there are written by my Wife, but I have contribued some posts as well. My posts turn out to be unsurprisingly technical, including a series of posts describing the time I installed 400 Watts of solar power on our Airstream. Since that might be of interest to the more technial audience over here, I've constructed a handy list of my solar posts over there.
